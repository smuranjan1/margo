All assignments I send will include a list of expectations, you can think of these as requirements that your code should be able to so. I will also include an example output so you can match the format. Please feel free to message me whenever you have any questitons.

Expectations:
- The user can input Rock Paper or Scissors, anything else should print an error
- The second user can also Rock Paper or Scissors, anything else should print an error
- The game should output who won, make sure to account for all cases including draws

Help:
- try to split the code up into one or two functions called from the main function (rememeber returning)
- use google or your sister if you need help (google first because you learn just by googling)
